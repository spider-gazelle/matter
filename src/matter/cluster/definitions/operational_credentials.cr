          #
          # ### Effect When Received
          #
          # If this command is received without an armed fail-safe context (see Section 11.9.6.2, “ArmFailSafe
          # Command”), then this command shall fail with a FAILSAFE_REQUIRED status code sent back to the initiator.
          #
          # If a prior UpdateNOC or AddNOC command was successfully executed within the fail-safe timer period, then
          # this command shall fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code sent back to the initiator.
          #
          # If the prior CSRRequest state that preceded AddNOC had the IsForUpdateNOC field indicated as true, then this
          # command shall fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code sent back to the initiator.
          #
          # If no prior AddTrustedRootCertificate command was successfully executed within the fail-safe timer period,
          # then this command shall process an error by responding with a NOCResponse with a StatusCode of InvalidNOC as
          # described in Section 11.17.6.7.2, “Handling Errors”. In other words,
          #
          # AddNOC always requires that the client provides the root of trust certificate within the same Fail- Safe
          # context as the rest of the new fabric’s operational credentials, even if some other fabric already uses the
          # exact same root of trust certificate.
          #
          # If the NOC provided in the NOCValue encodes an Operational Identifier for a <Root Public Key, FabricID> pair
          # already present on the device, then the device shall process the error by responding with a StatusCode of
          # FabricConflict as described in Section 11.17.6.7.2, “Handling Errors”.
          #
          # If the device already has the CommissionedFabrics attribute equal to the SupportedFabrics attribute, then
          # the device’s operational credentials table is considered full and the device shall process the error by
          # responding with a StatusCode of TableFull as described in Section 11.17.6.7.2, “Handling Errors”.
          #
          # If the CaseAdminSubject field is not a valid ACL subject in the context of AuthMode set to CASE, such as not
          # being in either the Operational or CASE Authenticated Tag range, then the device shall process the error by
          # responding with a StatusCode of InvalidAdminSubject as described in Section 11.17.6.7.2, “Handling Errors”.
          #
          # Otherwise, the command is considered an addition of credentials, also known as "joining a fabric", and the
          # following shall apply:
          #
          #   1. A new FabricIndex shall be allocated, taking the next valid fabric-index value in monotonically
          #       incrementing order, wrapping around from 254 (0xFE) to 1, since value 0 is reserved and using 255
          #       (0xFF) would prevent cluster specifications from using nullable fabric-idx fields.
          #
          #   2. An entry within the Fabrics attribute table shall be added, reflecting the matter-fabric-id RDN within
          #       the NOC’s subject, along with the public key of the trusted root of the chain and the AdminVendorID
          #       field.
          #
          #   3. The operational key pair associated with the incoming NOC from the NOCValue, and generated by the prior
          #       CSRRequest command, shall be recorded for subsequent use during CASE within the fail-safe timer period
          #       (see Section 5.5, “Commissioning Flows”).
          #
          #   4. The incoming NOCValue and ICACValue (if present) shall be stored under the FabricIndex associated with
          #       the new Fabric Scope, along with the RootCACertificate provided with the prior successful
          #       AddTrustedRootCertificate command invoked in the same fail-safe period.
          #
          #     a. Implementation of certificate chain storage may separate or otherwise encode the components of the
          #        array in implementation-specific ways, as long as they follow the correct format when being read from
          #        the NOCs list or used within other protocols such as CASE.
          #
          #   5. The NOCs list shall reflect the incoming NOC from the NOCValue field and ICAC from the ICACValue field
          #       (if present).
          #
          #   6. The operational discovery service record shall immediately reflect the new Operational Identifier, such
          #       that the Node immediately begins to exist within the Fabric and becomes reachable over CASE under the
          #       new operational identity.
          #
          #   7. The receiver shall create and add a new Access Control Entry using the CaseAdminSubject field to grant
          #       subsequent Administer access to an Administrator member of the new Fabric. It is RECOMMENDED that the
          #       Administrator presented in CaseAdminSubject exist within the same entity that is currently invoking
          #       the AddNOC command, within another of the Fabrics of which it is a member.
          #
          #   8. The incoming IPKValue shall be stored in the Fabric-scoped slot within the Group Key Management cluster
          #       (see KeySetWrite), for subsequent use during CASE.
          #
          #   9. The Fabric Index associated with the armed fail-safe context (see Section 11.9.6.2, “ArmFailSafe
          #       Command”) shall be updated to match the Fabric Index just allocated.
          #
          #   10. If the current secure session was established with PASE, the receiver shall:
          #
          #     a. Augment the secure session context with the FabricIndex generated above, such that subsequent
          #        interactions have the proper accessing fabric.
          #
          #   11. If the current secure session was established with CASE, subsequent configuration of the newly
          #       installed Fabric requires the opening of a new CASE session from the Administrator from the Fabric
          #       just installed. This Administrator is the one listed in the CaseAdminSubject argument.
          #
          # Thereafter, the Node shall respond with an NOCResponse with a StatusCode of OK and a FabricIndex field
