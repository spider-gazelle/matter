#!/bin/sh
# Supervises an example device binary inside its compose container, mirroring
# its output to a log file that the test runner (and the compose healthcheck)
# read to obtain the pairing code.
#
# Usage: E2E_DEVICE=matter_switch device-entrypoint.sh [args...]
#
# Restart protocol (the `tests` container has no docker socket, so restarts are
# requested through the shared /e2e/logs volume):
#
#   1. The runner creates the marker file `$E2E_LOG_DIR/<device>.restart`.
#   2. This script removes the marker and sends SIGTERM to the device, which
#      shuts down cleanly (flushing its storage) and exits.
#   3. `=== e2e restart <n> ===` is appended to `<device>.log` and the binary is
#      started again in the same working directory, so it reopens its storage
#      and comes up commissioned. The log is only truncated when the container
#      starts, so the pairing code stays in it and the healthcheck keeps passing.
#
# The device is only restarted after a marker was requested. If it exits on its
# own the container exits with the device's status, so crashes are not masked.
# SIGTERM/SIGINT (docker stop) are forwarded to the device and end the loop.
