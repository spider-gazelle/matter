# A structural guard over every `TLV::Serializable` field in the library.
#
# The door-lock bug was a payload declaring a field with a datatype wrapper the
# TLV shard cannot put on the wire, which turned every lock command into a
# `Failure` against a real controller. Nothing caught it, because a field type
# the shard does not know about is only a problem at the moment a message is
# actually encoded or decoded - and an event that no spec exercises end to end
# never reaches that moment.
#
# So walk the declarations instead of the traffic: every includer of
# `TLV::Serializable`, every instance variable carrying a `TLV::Field`
# annotation, flattened through nilable unions, `Array(...)` and tuples, and
# assert that nothing is left over.
#
# Both directions are checked, because they are answered by different overload
# sets: `serialize_value` for the encoder, `deserialize_value` for the decoder.
# Each set is read out of the shard at macro time rather than hand-maintained,
# so a type this library registers through `define_id`
# (`src/matter/datatype/id.cr`) counts as supported without being listed here.
#
# Until tlv 1.1.0 the two were not symmetric: the decoder's union branch matched
# a closed list of members with no fallback, so a registered type encoded as a
# field and then raised on `from_slice` the moment the field became nilable.
# That is fixed upstream; this spec now holds both sides to the same rule.
module TLVFieldTypes
  # Fields whose type the encoder cannot serialize.
